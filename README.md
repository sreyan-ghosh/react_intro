# Introduction to React

The entire project is centered in the src directory with the configuration files of the formatters outside it.

This repository hosts the 'Adopt Pets!' project taught by btholt in the Frontend Masters' Complete Intro to React course.

#### Timeline:

##### Commit 1:

As of 02.09.20, I have set up the formatter and bundler and written raw React in the App.js and Pet.js files. Will be moving on to JSX next.

##### Commit 2:

This is the second commit of 02.09.20. I have worked my way down with hooks using "useState" and also creating custom hooks like "useDropdown" in <b>useDropdown.js</b> to increase reusability of code. The other thing I did was include effects by calling "useEffects" that enabled me to call an external API and query it for data related to pet adoption. The locations for the search query are limited to <b>Seattle, WA</b> and <b>San Francisco, CA</b>.
