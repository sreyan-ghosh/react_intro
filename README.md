# Introduction to React

The entire project is centered in the src directory with the configuration files of the formatters outside it.

This repository hosts the 'Adopt Pets!' project taught by btholt in the Frontend Masters' Complete Intro to React course.

#### Timeline:

As of 02.09.20, I have set up the formatter and bundler and written raw React in the App.js and Pet.js files. Will be moving on to JSX next.
